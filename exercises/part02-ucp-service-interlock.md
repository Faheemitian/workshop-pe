# Interlock/Layer-7 configuration

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

 - Use UCP provided ingress layer 7 (interlock) feature for SWARM serrvices
 

## Part 1 - Enable Interlock feature

We will use a multilayer WORDPRESS app to be available through the interlock service.

1. Log into your UCP installation with an admin user, e.g. `admin`

2. Make sure all services and deployments have been deleted

3. Select your admin user name and select `Admin Settings`

4. Navigate to Layer 7 Routing and set the following values:
 - Enable Layer 7 Routing: switched on
 - HTTP Port: 8000
 - HTTPS Port: 8443

## Part 2 - Deploy the service as STACK via UCP Web UI

1. Make sure the previous created services have been deleted.

2. Select `Shared Resources` and select `Stacks`. Click the `Create Stack` button on the upper right side.

3. Provide the application name **MYAPP** in `Application Name`, select Orchestrator Mode `Swarm`and choose the `Application File Mode - Compose File` and click `Next`

4. Copy and paste the following COMPOSE-FILE:
```
version: '3.3'

services:
   db:
     image: mysql:5.7
     volumes:
       - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
     networks:
       - backend
     restart: always
     environment:
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ThisIsSecret
       MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
       MYSQL_USER: wordpress
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: ThisIsAlsoSecret

   wordpress:
     deploy:
      labels:
        com.docker.lb.hosts: wordpress.docker.com
        com.docker.lb.network: MYAPP_frontend
        com.docker.lb.port: 80
     image: wordpress:latest   
     volumes:
       - web_data:/var/www/html
     networks:
       - backend
       - frontend         
     environment:
       WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
       WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
       WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
       WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: ThisIsAlsoSecret

networks:
  backend:
  frontend:

volumes:
  db_data: 
  web_data: 
```

Click `Create` and `Done`

## Part 3 - Change your HOSTS to reflect the Linux Worker Node

Our service will now react on http://wordpress.docker.com:8000. Since this is not an official adress, we need to create a HOSTS entry to reflect the host.

Your HOSTS file should mirror something like this:
```
3.122.151.145 wordpress.docker.com
```

**NOTE:** When you use DCI, Load balancers at Azure/AWS might already point to Port 8000 so you can actually use the NORMAL HTTP 80 to look at your page.

UCP provides an easy to use, build in ingress controller.
